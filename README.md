# HPC Starter Guide

Welcome to the HPC Starter Guide for **LULU Supercomputers**! This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive tutorials and resources for individuals who are new to high-performance computing (HPC) and are looking to learn about SSH for secure remote access and SLURM for job scheduling and management.

## About
High-performance computing (HPC) plays a crucial role in scientific research, data analysis, and computational simulations by providing the computational power necessary to tackle complex problems. However, for beginners, navigating the world of HPC can be daunting. This guide aims to simplify the learning process by offering step-by-step tutorials and explanations on key concepts and tools used in HPC environments.

## Tutorials
Our tutorials cover the following topics:

* **SSH (Secure Shell)**: SSH is a cryptographic network protocol for secure remote login and command execution. Learn how to use SSH to connect to remote HPC systems securely.

* **SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)**: SLURM is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. Discover how to use SLURM for job scheduling, management, and resource allocation in HPC clusters.

These tutorials are designed to be beginner-friendly, providing clear instructions and examples to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively.
